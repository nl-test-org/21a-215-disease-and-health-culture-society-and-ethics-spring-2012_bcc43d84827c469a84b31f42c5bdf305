Sweeping Assertions
-------------------

In your papers, watch unsupported assertions.

A phrase like "condition X is not found in other cultures where the body is seen differently" will have to be documented. This is a pretty tall order if you say "in other cultures"! If you introduce other cultures you will need to provide evidence. So I would say something like "in some other cultures" and choose one or two specific cultures and show the contrast. Sweeping, unsupported assertions weaken your argument.

Databases
---------

Databases provide searchable collections or resources.

A good anthropology source (a searchable collection of articles from the top journals) is:

*   JSTOR.com
*   JSTOR will not supply the most recent journal issues.
*   Lexis-Nexis for newspaper and magazine articles.
*   Sociological Abstracts for sociology, including medical sociology
*   You may also want to consult the Proquest General Reference database for both magazine articles and peer reviewed articles.

Late Paper Policy
-----------------

Remember, papers must be handed in ON TIME unless an arrangement has been made for an extension at least 24 hours ahead of due date and the new deadline is specified.

Late papers lose a letter grade of credit each day.

No exceptions—you may not be able to meet a paper deadline, but you certainly are capable of writing me and arranging a new deadline, at least 24 hours ahead of time.

It's very important to keep agreements, and a paper due date is precisely that. If you find you cannot keep an agreement, then re-negotiate it. Don't just disappear without contacting me (or anyone you're in a relationship with); it's immature, rude, and puts you in a bad light—unnecessarily, as all you need to do is re-negotiate.
